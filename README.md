For this challenge, take the last project you worked (the eCommerce Database Project) and Dockerize it. You are with a different pair than you were for that project, so between the two of you, decide which would be better to Dockerize. If you need to get a link from your previous pair, please do so now.

We should be able to easily install and run your project on any machine.

Please do so and submit a link below to the Github repository where your project lives.
